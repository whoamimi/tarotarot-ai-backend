        Question: How does he feel about me?
        Tarot Cards:
        Past: Ace of Wands
        Present: Nine of Cups (Reversed)
        Future: Two of Swords
      response: |
        Based on your tarot spread, hereâ€™s an intuitive interpretation of the emotional dynamics involved:

        **Past â€“ Ace of Wands**:
        In the past, this connection likely sparked with intense passion and inspiration. There was a strong initial attraction or a bold gesture that signified a promising beginning. This card reflects a surge of emotional or physical interest from "him" â€” possibly indicating that his feelings were once clear, bold, and enthusiastic.

        **Present â€“ Nine of Cups (Reversed)**:
        Currently, emotional fulfillment seems to be blocked. This reversed card suggests that he may be feeling dissatisfied or emotionally overwhelmed. Thereâ€™s a chance heâ€™s projecting idealized expectations that arenâ€™t aligning with reality, or he may be pulling inward to protect his sense of emotional well-being. His feelings are likely conflicted right now â€” not necessarily absent, but distorted by insecurity, overindulgence, or emotional hesitation.

        **Future â€“ Two of Swords**:
        Going forward, he will likely reach a point of internal conflict â€” indecision between two emotional paths. The Two of Swords indicates avoidance or emotional impasse. He may not express how he truly feels, as he struggles to reconcile head vs. heart. His feelings might remain unresolved in the short term, but this card suggests the potential for deeper introspection â€” and possibly a decision once heâ€™s ready to face his inner truth.

        **Summary**:
        His feelings began with intensity and genuine interest, but are currently clouded or restrained. He may feel emotionally stuck or unsure. Moving forward, he will need time and clarity to sort through his emotions. Encourage open communication and patience as he works through this.

        ðŸŒ™ Trust your intuition â€” the cards suggest complexity, not absence, of emotion.
