        Question: How does he feel about me?
        Tarot Cards:
        Past: Ace of Wands
        Present: Nine of Cups (Reversed)
        Future: Two of Swords
      response: |
        Based on your tarot spread, here‚Äôs an intuitive interpretation of the emotional dynamics involved:

        **Past ‚Äì Ace of Wands**:
        In the past, this connection likely sparked with intense passion and inspiration. There was a strong initial attraction or a bold gesture that signified a promising beginning. This card reflects a surge of emotional or physical interest from "him" ‚Äî possibly indicating that his feelings were once clear, bold, and enthusiastic.

        **Present ‚Äì Nine of Cups (Reversed)**:
        Currently, emotional fulfillment seems to be blocked. This reversed card suggests that he may be feeling dissatisfied or emotionally overwhelmed. There‚Äôs a chance he‚Äôs projecting idealized expectations that aren‚Äôt aligning with reality, or he may be pulling inward to protect his sense of emotional well-being. His feelings are likely conflicted right now ‚Äî not necessarily absent, but distorted by insecurity, overindulgence, or emotional hesitation.

        **Future ‚Äì Two of Swords**:
        Going forward, he will likely reach a point of internal conflict ‚Äî indecision between two emotional paths. The Two of Swords indicates avoidance or emotional impasse. He may not express how he truly feels, as he struggles to reconcile head vs. heart. His feelings might remain unresolved in the short term, but this card suggests the potential for deeper introspection ‚Äî and possibly a decision once he‚Äôs ready to face his inner truth.

        **Summary**:
        His feelings began with intensity and genuine interest, but are currently clouded or restrained. He may feel emotionally stuck or unsure. Moving forward, he will need time and clarity to sort through his emotions. Encourage open communication and patience as he works through this.

        üåô Trust your intuition ‚Äî the cards suggest complexity, not absence, of emotion.

    prompt: |
      You are a tarot reading assistant. Given the user's question, drawn tarot cards with their respective positions, your task is to interpret the cards in the context of numerology patterns.
    response_format: |
      **Numerical Energy**:
      Identify the number associated for each tarot card and brief their associated symbolic meanings in one sentence.

      **Numerology Insights**:
      Identify and highlight any meaningful numerology cues such as:
        - Repeating digits (e.g., 111, 333)
        - Sequential numbers (e.g., 1-2-3, 7-8-9)
        - Mirrored or palindromic patterns (e.g., 121, 44)
        - Culturally or spiritually significant numbers (e.g., 7 for introspection, 9 for completion or endings, 5 for change)
        - Adding the digits together to interpret the significance of the number.
      If no numerology patterns are clearly present, then:
        - Offer an interpretation based on the numerical values of the cards (e.g.- how many Major Arcana vs Minor Arcana; predominance of certain suits or ranks like ‚Äúcourt cards‚Äù)
        - Suggest adjacent symbolic insights (e.g., elemental associations, themes across suits, emotional undercurrents)
        - Highlight the absence of numerical repetition as meaningful‚Äîe.g., representing diversity, complexity, or a transitional phase
      If relevant, suggest associated angel numbers and their spiritual meanings. Explain the symbolic or emotional relevance these patterns may have in the context of the user‚Äôs question and life journey.

        Question: How does he feel about me?
        Tarot Cards:
        Past: Ace of Wands
        Present: Nine of Cups (Reversed)
        Future: Two of Swords
      response: "**Numerical Energy**

        -\tAce (1) ‚Äî Symbolizes new beginnings, passion, and a spark of
        potential in the past.

        -\tNine (9) ‚Äî Represents emotional fulfillment, but its reversed
        position may suggest emotional blockage, self-indulgence, or superficial
        satisfaction in the present.

        -\tTwo (2) ‚Äî Often reflects duality, indecision, or the need for balance
        and choice in the future.


        **Numerology Insights**

        You‚Äôve drawn 1, 9, and 2 ‚Äî not a repeating or sequential pattern, but
        each number has a distinct role:

        -\t1 marks initiation ‚Äî this may symbolize when the connection first
        ignited or when feelings initially emerged.

        -\t9, being the highest single-digit number, often signals endings or
        fulfillment ‚Äî its reversed state might show unmet emotional needs or
        avoidance of deeper feelings.

        -\t2 relates to decisions and emotional sensitivity ‚Äî the person may be
        currently unsure or weighing options emotionally, possibly torn between
        head and heart.\n"

      You are a tarot reading assistant. Given the user's question, drawn tarot cards with their respective positions, your task is to interpret the cards in the context of the cards' respective elemental associations:
        - Wands ‚Üí Fire
        - Cups ‚Üí Water
        - Swords ‚Üí Air
        - Pentacles ‚Üí Earth

      In a 3-4 sentences, describe how the balance or dominance of these elements in the spread affects the reading. Highlight if an element is missing, overrepresented, or in conflict. Relate elemental symbolism to the user‚Äôs stated intention or question.

        Tarot Cards:
        Past: Ace of Wands
        Present: Nine of Cups (Reversed)
        Future: Two of Swords
      response: |
        Fire (Wands), Water (Cups), and Air (Swords) are all present, indicating a multidimensional emotional situation. The Ace of Wands in the past suggests initial attraction and passion‚Äîperhaps impulsive or exciting beginnings. The present reversed Nine of Cups (Water) reflects emotional discontent or unrealistic expectations, possibly indicating he's currently withdrawn or emotionally unfulfilled. The Two of Swords (Air) points to future indecision‚Äîhe may be emotionally blocked or refusing to confront his feelings. The absence of Earth (Pentacles) shows a lack of grounding or commitment in his emotions, implying this connection is more emotional and mental than practical or stable.
